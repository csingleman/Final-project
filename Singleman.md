**Project title:** Sharing information on the consequences of human impacts on Atlantic coast rivers 

*2 Sentence abstract:*  
I propose to build an interactive website that will look at the differences of ecosystem structure and fish populations in dredged and undredged rivers along the Atlantic coast. This website will be widely accessible including interactive maps showing changes in fish population, and toxin levels over time, background information pages for understanding the implications of toxin exposure, current research on the toxins and fish species affected and ways to get involved with the efforts to remove toxins from undredged sites. 

*What resources do you have now?*   
1. Current peer reviewed research articles & summaries for background information  
2. Basic knowledge of HTML/CSS, mapping, databases and data storage options  
3. Contacts of more experienced collaborators and/or mentors to complete the project

*What have you learned this week that will help you?*  
I've learned the basics of HTML/CSS, mapping, databases, GitHub, Javascript to the point that I am aware of some possiblities of using each of these technologies and who and where to look for help. 

*What additional support will you need as you take your next steps?*  
Besides more time in the day to complete such a project, I will definitely need help with creating the maps and websites, which will likely mean taking more thorough classes. Alternately, I might be able to get specific help for issues on a one of one basis or through online searches.
